## Hi there 👋
My name is Zichen LIU (刘子辰),

- 🔭 I’m currently a 3rd year Ph.D. student in [Visual Intelligence Lab](https://cqf.io/lab.html), at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), supervised by [Prof. Qifeng CHEN](https://cqf.io/).

- 📖 My research interests lie in Generative AI and Human-AI Collaboration. I’m particularly interested in developing AI tools that can understand and execute creative intentions without requiring users to master complex skills, essentially making advanced AI capabilities feel natural and effortless to use.
